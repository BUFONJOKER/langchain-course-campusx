Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security.
It operates on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.
Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not controlled by a central authority.
Transactions are verified by a distributed network of computers.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced in 2009.
It was created by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
Cryptocurrencies enable peer-to-peer transactions over the internet.
They eliminate the need for intermediaries like banks.
Every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded on a blockchain.
This ensures transparency and reduces the risk of fraud.
Cryptocurrencies use private and public keys for security.
A public key acts like an address to receive funds.
A private key allows the owner to access and send funds.
Losing a private key means losing access to the assets permanently.
Ethereum is another popular cryptocurrency platform.
Ethereum introduced smart contracts to the crypto ecosystem.
Smart contracts automatically execute agreements when conditions are met.
